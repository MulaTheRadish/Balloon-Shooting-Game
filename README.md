# Balloon-Shooting-Game

A simple balloon shooting game I had created to add to my portfolio. 

The requirements for the game were as follows:
- The Balloon should move up and down randomly.
- The player can shoot one bullet at a time or multiple bullets at a time.
- The game ends when the balloon is shot down, please show the number of missed
shots.
- The bullet speed should be 10 times the speed of the balloon.

Learning pygame was like learning a new langauge; what with the completely unknown API and all. 
It was a challenging experience, however, it was very rewarding.

I completed it by dissolving the game into 3 primary parts:
- Bullet class
- Gun class
- Balloon class

Using a rect for each class to create a sprite and watching their collisions was the easy part. The hard part was getting all of it to work together. Particularly the bullet class.
